# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
V. Isualize has given me and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
From running the data we can tell the below key differences in it amount the different city types:
* As predicted, Urban cities have the largest number of rides and total of drivers. Consequently, the total fares is also larger.

* However, rural cities although do not have the largest number of riders, the average fare per ride is almost $10 higher than those of Urban cities.

* The average fare per driver in rural cities is $38.92 more than those of Urban cities.

* Suburban cities are right in the middle of all these numbers.

* During the months of January through April in 2019, we can easily observe that urban city types had the highest total fares while rural had the lowest.

* There does not look to be any similarties between city types, except on the last week of March where they all peaked.

## Summary
From the results, we can recommend the below options to address the disparities amount the city types.

* Putting a cap on the total fare price regardless of city might be helpful as we notice the difference in fare from Urban to rural is more than 50%. This might bring more consumers from the rural cities, thus bringing more revenue and more dirvers.

* It might be worth putting together more data to identify which cities whithin Urban, rural and suburban are actually bringing in the most revenues and identyfying commonalities in order to serve the public better.

* The company could possibly increase the number of dirvers and publicity in suburban cities as the market could be more profitable. The reason for this is that Suburban is closer to rural (short by $4) on the average fare per ride but has more than three times the riders.
