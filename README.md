# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
V. Isualize has given me and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
From running the data we can tell the below key differences in it amount the different city types:
* As predicted, Urban cities have the largest number of rides and total of drivers. Consequently, the total fares is also larger.
* However, rural cities although do not have the largest number of riders, the average fare per ride is almost $10 higher than those of Urban cities.
* The average fare per driver in rural cities is $38.92 more than those of Urban cities.
* Suburban cities are right in the middle of all these numbers.

* During the months of January through April in 2019, we can easily observe

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
